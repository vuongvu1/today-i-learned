1. **UI Semantics**: Use proper HTML tags to make the UI clearer for all users, including those with assistive tools.
2. **Content Structure**

   * **Headings**: Follow a logical order (e.g., H1, H2) to make content easier to navigate.
   * **Landmarks**: Use roles like `navigation` and `main` to mark key sections for easier access.
3. **Navigation**: Help users know where they are in the app.  

   * **Page Title**: Set a unique title for each page.
   * **Active Item**: Mark the active menu item visually and in the code.
4. **Font Size & Zoom**: Make text and elements readable when zoomed in.  

   * **Minimum Size**: Use at least 16px font size.
   * **Zoom Testing**: Ensure the page works well at 200% zoom.
5. **Colors & UI Contrast**: Ensure all colors and contrasts are clear and accessible.  

   * **Text Contrast**: Use enough contrast between text and background.
   * **Color**: Donâ€™t rely only on color to show meaning, add icons or labels too.
6. **Keyboard Operability**: Make everything accessible by keyboard alone.  

   * **Focus Outline**: Make focused elements clearly visible.
   * **Focus Order**: Ensure focus moves in a logical order.
7. **Dexterity**: Keep buttons and other elements large enough to click or tap easily.  

   * **Minimum Button Size**: Use a minimum of 44x44px for buttons.
8. **Robust Forms**: Make forms easy to fill out and understand.  

   * **Labels**: Link labels to form fields to make input clearer.
