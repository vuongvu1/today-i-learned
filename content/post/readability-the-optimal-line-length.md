title: "Readability: The Optimal Line Length"
---
> * The optimal line length for body text is 50–75 characters
> * Shorter or longer line lengths can hurt readability
> * Our large-scale testing reveals that text line length often makes product or service descriptions unnecessarily difficult for users to read

CSS has a built-in unit for this purpose—the `ch` unit:

```css
<style>
  p {
    max-width: 50ch;
  }
</style>
```
