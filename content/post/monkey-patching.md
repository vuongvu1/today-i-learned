title: Monkey patching
---
> Monkey patching refers to the dynamic (run-time) modification of a class or module. It is an advanced topic in Python and involves altering the behavior of code during execution without changing the original source code.
>
> Itâ€™s particularly useful for fixing bugs, adding missing features, or adapting third-party libraries to better suit specific requirements. Remember that while monkey patching provides flexibility, it should be used judiciously to avoid unintended side effects and maintain code readability
