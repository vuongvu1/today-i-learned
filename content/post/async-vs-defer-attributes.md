# <script>

The HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will be made to fetch the file (if itâ€™s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.

# <script async>

`async` downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.

# <script defer>

`defer` downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. `defer` scripts are also guaranteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.
