### Detail comes later

> It’s important that you don’t get hung up making low-level decisions about things like typefaces, shadows, icons, etc. 

### Limit your choices

> When you’re designing using a constrained set of values, decision-making is a lot easier because there are a lot fewer “right” choices. 

### Size isn’t everything

> Instead of leaving all of the heavy lifting to font size alone, try using font weight or color to do the same job. 
>
> For example, using a softer color for supporting text instead of a tiny font size makes it clear that the text is secondary while sacrificing less on readability 

### Labels are a last resort

> When presenting data to the user (especially data from the database), it’s easy to fall into the trap of displaying it using a naive label: value format. 
>
> The problem with this approach is that it makes it difficult to present the data with any sort of hierarchy; every piece of data is given equal emphasis. 

### Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy

> Don’t let the element you’re using influence how you choose to style it — pick elements for semantic purposes and style them however you need to create the best visual hierarchy.
