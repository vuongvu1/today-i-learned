title: JSR - New package registry
---
### Made for **TypeScript & ESM**

JSR is designed for TypeScript. You publish TypeScript source, and JSR handles generating API docs, `.d.ts` files, and transpiling your code for cross-runtime compatibility.

JSR packages are distributed as web-standard ECMAScript modules.

### **Builds on** npm

JSR isn't a replacement for the npm registry; it's a superset of npm.

JSR modules can be used with any JavaScript package manager, and in any project with a `node_modules` folder.

### Works with **any runtime**

JSR modules can be used in Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, and more.

Module authors can count on great editor support from strongly typed modules, without the need to transpile and distribute typings manually.
