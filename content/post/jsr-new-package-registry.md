title: JSR - New package registry
---
### Made for **TypeScript & ESM**

JSR is designed for TypeScript. You publish TypeScript source, and JSR handles generating API docs, `.d.ts` files, and transpiling your code for cross-runtime compatibility.

### **Builds on** npm

JSR isn't a replacement for the npm registry; it's a superset of npm. JSR modules can be used with any JavaScript package manager.

### Works with **any runtime**

JSR modules can be used in Node.js, Deno, Bun, and more.
