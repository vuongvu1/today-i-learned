# Today I Learned

URL: https://til.vuongvu.xyz

Hi there, I'm Vuong Vu, a frontend developer. I've encountered many interesting things during my work and learning journey, but I often forget them and end up searching for the same information repeatedly.

Today, I discovered the "Today I Learned" (TIL) concept, and it fits my needs for a few reasons:

    I want a place to note down interesting things just for myself.
    It doesn't require lengthy blog posts; short notes are enough.
    It's a great way for me to practice writing in English.

Nice to meet you here! ♥️
